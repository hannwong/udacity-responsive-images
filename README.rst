=========================
 Installing Dependencies
=========================

Install ``grunt-cli`` globally.

All other packages can be installed locally. (In fact, ``grunt`` *has* to be local.)

Install *ImageMagick* (``brew install ImageMagick`` on Mac). Currently using version 6.9.6-5.


Warnings to Ignore
==================

All warnings are generated by packages recommended by Udacity.

These 4 warnings are generated by the installation of ``grunt v0.4.5``::

  npm WARN deprecated minimatch@0.2.14: Please update to minimatch 3.0.2 or higher to avoid a RegExp DoS issue
  npm WARN deprecated minimatch@0.3.0: Please update to minimatch 3.0.2 or higher to avoid a RegExp DoS issue
  npm WARN deprecated graceful-fs@1.2.3: graceful-fs v3.0.0 and before will fail on node releases >= v7.0. Please update to graceful-fs@^4.0.0 as soon as possible. Use 'npm ls graceful-fs' to find it in the tree.

This warning by ``grunt-contrib-jshint v2.5.11``::

  npm WARN prefer global jshint@2.5.11 should be installed with -g

In future, the ``grunt`` dependency in ``devDependencies`` should correctly omit this warning; an end-user of a top-level package (like ``grunt``) should not have to care how the package author includes the package's dependencies. Upcoming fix could be here: `npm/npm#9409<https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9409>`_.

This warning by ``grunt-contrib-nodeunit v0.4.1``::

  npm WARN deprecated node-uuid@1.4.7: use uuid module instead
